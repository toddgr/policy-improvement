# Implementing the Policy Improvement Algorithm

This project aims to find the optimal policy for Markov's Decision Process models in Python. The actual policy improvement algorithm is in the `pia.py` file, and benchmark test cases can be found and applied if `tb.py` is run. The test cases are not as ideal as I would like them to be... in future commits to this repo, I hope to improve them a bit and make them a little less conditional/random.
